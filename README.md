# Chapter 3 - State Variables and Integers

State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB.


# Chapter 4 - Math Operations

- Addition: x + y
- Subtraction: x - y,
- Multiplication: x * y
- Division: x / y
- Modulus / remainder: x % y (for example, 13 % 5 is 3, because if you divide 5 into 13, 3 is the remainder)

# Chapter 5 - Structs

```
struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}
```
